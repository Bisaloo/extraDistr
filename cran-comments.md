I switched to C++11. I fixed some design mistakes and re-written the code in several places, so now it should be easier to maintain and be less error-prone. Few bugs were found and fixed. I improved exception handling. For beta binomial, beta negative-binomial and gamma-Poisson distributions memoization technique is now used what should have massive influence on performance of the code (previously in some rare occasions it could be really slow and unusable). I added multiple new tests. Code was tested on Linux and Windows (TravisCI & AppVeyor). Four new distributions were added. There were some changes in the already-available distributions, e.g. truncated Poisson was changed to allow for lower and upper truncation points. Documentation was improved.
