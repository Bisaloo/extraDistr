While building on linux the following note appears:

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  8.3Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   8.0Mb
    
It is similar to the one described recently [1]. This package depends
only on Rcpp and some standard linux libraries (stl).
